    "# You performed a t-test comparing income between males and females and obtained a p-value of 0.03. What does this result suggest?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Answer:\n",
    "A p-value of 0.03 indicates that there is only a 3% chance that the observed difference in income between males and females occurred by random chance. Since the p-value is below the typical threshold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in income between genders in our sample.\n",

    "# An ANOVA test comparing income across three education levels gave an F-statistic of 5.23 and a p-value of 0.007. What can we conclude?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Answer:\n",
    "The p-value of 0.007 is less than 0.05, suggesting that there is a statistically significant difference in average income across the three education level groups. However, ANOVA does not tell us which specific groups differ — for that, we would need to conduct a post-hoc test such as Tukey's HSD.\n",
    "🔗 3. Chi-Square Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "# You run a chi-square test between gender and target variable (0/1 outcome), and obtain a p-value of 0.12. What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Answer:\n",
    "A p-value of 0.12 is greater than the common significance level of 0.05, meaning we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is an association between gender and the target outcome in this sample.\n",
    "📈 4. Correlation Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "# You find a Pearson correlation of 0.65 between education_score and income, with a p-value of 0.0001. What does this tell you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Answer:\n",
    "A correlation coefficient of 0.65 indicates a moderately strong positive linear relationship between education score and income: as education score increases, income tends to increase as well. The very small p-value suggests this correlation is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random chance.\n",
    "❓ 5. General: What Is a P-Value?\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a p-value, and how should it be interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Answer:\n",
    "A p-value is the probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, what we observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests that the observed result is unlikely under the null hypothesis and provides evidence to reject it. However, it does not measure effect size or practical importance."
